Result:
	Complished all assignment. Properly print the character, hexadecimal, integer,
	float, and double value in the GDB. 

Difficulties:
	Not really hard but it contains some conplicated and confused conception which
	may be only able to solved by memorization. It is very crtical point that I
	should memorize or know some of the basic type of variables and how to print
	with proper way.
	Using GDB was very new but it was okay to use since UIs helped alot.

What did you learn:
        Honestly, this lab was the most useful lab so far. The reason I felt it was
	useful is I always felt confused about those kind of matching formatting of the
	print session.
	Also it is good to know how to use the GDB actually.
