Results:
	Got the result of what the lab showed.

	-- $wc < haiku
	 3  5 32

	-- $./test
	Nothing much
	The letter A
	A string: Splash!
	The number 11
	The number b in hexadecimal
	-5 is a negative number
	The number 65
	The number 41 in hexadecimal

Difficulties:
	In this lab most of the questions were not really hard but the wc function
	was little comfused due to the 'nextline' session.

What did you learn:
     	 From this lab, I learned how to print the specific type of the varialbes
	 and can count and get the files directly like how to get haiku.
