1. Questions
1) What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?

   CS pins make to be ablt to communicate with machine.

2)Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?

      CS high make us to stop communicate with machine more easily which mean we can control the machine much easier. GYRO_CS_LOW/GYRO_CS_HIGH those two functions can change to CS from high to low and low to high repectively.

3) How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?

   Intinalize the machine then connect the cable to proper position then it connect with local machine.

4)The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?

      rate: 8
      Frequency: 9

5)Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?

       Yes, to adjust transmission speed for each machine for communication.

Difficulties and learn:
I had suffered for figure out how to coding for gyro write function. But dicussing with UI, I figure it out. Also in the report number 4 was quite not understandable so that I search on the Internet to figure out. But since I figure out how to detect the gyro and getting values, I learned lots and pretty cofidence about it.
