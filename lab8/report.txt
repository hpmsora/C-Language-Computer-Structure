Electrical Characteristics
The accelerometer/magnetometer is from 2.16 ~ 3.6
The accelerometer is located right side fo the pins below
the user usb port.

Q2)
To keep recieving the data to acceleromer/magnetomer.

Q3)
The for loop changes the accelerometer data to human language
which we can understand more easier.

Q4)
Tilt compass would be more accurate when it used by pitch and roll are not 0 degree.

Difficulties
It is difficult to figure out what roll and pitch doing and what those data means.
Also visualization part was also hard to do that due to calculate the position.
