Q1.) What are we doing here and how does it relate to what we know about SPI?

High means SPI putting SPI bus so that can operate other functions
Low means waiting for other data


Q2.) Explain how you might use the *f3d_delay_uS()* function
  within the *delay()* function to replace the delay loop
  below. What would you expect to be the advantage of using a
  timer over a delay loop?

replaying repeat indead delay.


Q3.) Read chapter 12 in the lab manual which covers DMA (direct memory access).
  Why might DMA be important in improving the performance of your image display application?

Using D<A make LCD application to the data putting in the application so that it
makes whole machine working.


Q4.) Research the FAT file system and describe the function of the file allocation
  table. Explain how the corruption of an entry in the table can cause part of a file to be lost.

FAT keeps the track of the data and file location. If the entry corruption the FAT
does not accept any file anymore.


Q5.) What is the difference between FAT16 and FAT32? 

FAT16: Much more restrict
FAT32: more size supported



Dificulties:
The drawing picture was quite difficult but it is easy to solve later. Also the rc=3 problem
was terrible. The major solution for rc=3 was just changing machine.

Learned
Mostly how to read the image and change different format.
