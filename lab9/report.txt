Q1.

The reason is all the initialization is in the i2c src file.

Q2.

Credit by Internet
"There's no specification on what byte mode when reading through the nunchuk"

Q3

  unsigned char jx; -> joystick x-axis variable output: 1 ~ 255
  unsigned char jy; -> joystick y-axis variable output: 1 ~ 255
  unsigned short ax; -> joystick x accel
  unsigned short ay; -> joystick y accel
  unsigned short az; -> joystick z accel
  unsigned char c; -> joystick's c button press or not: 1 or 0
  unsigned char z; -> joystick's z button press or not: 1 or 0

Q4

Set z and c to 1 or 0
arrows means getting value in data structure.


Difficulties
The major difficulties to read the joystick's variable as datastructure way.
Previously most of the data's form as number or array but this time was
data structure.

Learned
I learned how to use the nunchuk which related to other devices than the
ST board. Also much more confidence for swiching screens.
