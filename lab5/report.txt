1. How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
   
   4 connection required; USB, RX, TX, GND connections.

2. What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for  GPIO pins?
   
   The Purpose of alternate functions is to protect the using 
   peripheral from other using; refering as general function.

3. Define "baud rate" in your own words.
   
   Baud rate is one of the rate of the time to trasfering the
   data throughout the machine.

4. Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason
   that printf won't work on the board without it?
   
   The reason we cannot use printf without newlib_stubs is the
   machine cannot calculate the printf instead the machine knows
   about getchar so that the newlib_stubs function is a fucntion
   that helping the putchar and get char function.

5. Give an example of a situation in which the salae Logic Analyzer
   is the best bebugging method and include a screen shot of the
   Logic application.

   When the programmer did not found the error or need to know
   exactly what is foing on in the trasferring process between
   the machine and local computer.
   Screenshot: check the Screenshot.png file.

What did you lean, any difficulties you had?

I was suffering when they asked to do Logic Analyzer. This part
was my the last one after I finished all the code. The Logic
Analyzer was quite new machine that I had never used before.
I like to learn about machine and I learned alot from coding
for the machine(STM32 board) but the funniest part was Logic
Analyzer even it was the hardest part. I know how to analyze
the computer signal even it was very simple and the graph
the analyzer show was quite interesting.
