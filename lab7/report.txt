Question:

1.
	Advantage: easy to check the errors and easy to approach the result
	Dieadcantage: slowing down the machine so much

2.
	spiReadWrite getting what to print on the LCD screen on the machine.
	So, we need to put on higher level to the informations going through
	the spiReadWrite.

3.
	LCD_CS_Deassert()
	First of all, it initialize the machine control, makes rectangles and
	sets the color of the shape or background.
	The reason LCD_CS_Deassert() is important is it is a macro to machine
	control to keep working the method.

4.
	Due to the ASCII code already defined in the program which each characters
	refers to 8-Bits binary code. So the machine interprets the ASCII code to
	machine language.

5.
	Due to the printf is not on the analyzer, it make function much faster.

=============================================
Difficulties

This lab was relatively easier than other labs and was very interesting
because we could design most of the programs. However, One of the most difficult
parts of this lab checking slowing down the function due to printf because the
difference of the speed was not really visible first few attempt. But later then,
we realized we need press the button several more times.
