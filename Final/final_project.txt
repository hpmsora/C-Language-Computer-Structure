2-Player Snake
--------------

Each player has a wii nunchuk that controls a snake.
Player 1 controls the green snake on the left side of the screen,
Player 2 controls the red snake on the right side of the screen.
Players move around the board trying to collect the blue "food" blocks.
When a player eats food, their snake grows by one unit.
Whoever has the longer snake when all the food is consumed wins.
If any player collides with themself, their opponent, or a wall,
they lose immediately.
