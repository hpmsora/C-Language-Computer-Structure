Task:

- Come up with idea for game: Won Yong
- Initialize Wii nunchuk and read direction input from it: Won Yong
- Wire the board every single time: Won Yong
- Implement a linked list data structure to remember snake movement: Collaborative
- Load and play audio files from SD card: Collaborative

In our final project, I mostly handled with "nunchuk". Because I suggested
the idea of the final project which was primarly using two nunchuk, I needed
to figure out how to use both nunchuk in one time.

For "initialize Wii nunchuk and read direction input form it", I was suffering
to wire the proper pins which was PA9 and PA10. Because the wire should be on
very specific pins as "PA", I needed to change from "B" initializing to "A"
initializing.

Also max did his own works on the simulator, we needed to change to adjust to
actual board.

After wiring board, we figure out that out snake should be the "linkedlist". We
originally using the struct for saving the size and direction then we realized
the snakes needed to remember the previous directions for following tails. That
part was the very confusing part.


Techical Challenge

There was two major challenge on our project.
 - find the proper pins for second nunchuk
 - make snake
Due to the STM board required the specific nunchuk pins for second nunchuk, we
were suffering to find and initialize.
Also the snake should recognized the previous direction and size we need to
adjust the data structure.


Project Start Over

I probably using similar designed or technics but I want to added more functions.
Such as making sound when snake eat "food" or mini games after "game over".
